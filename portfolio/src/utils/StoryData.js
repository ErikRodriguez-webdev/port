      "At some point during this time, I ran into an ad on Instagram. I'm not sure why I decided to stop scrolling on my Instagram feed that day, but the ad's caption got my attention. The caption read, 'Attend a school that invests in its students. Click here to learn more about our ISA.' I clicked... and once I was convinced... I talked it over with my brother.

      "Fast forward half a year, my brother and I have learned how to build websites from scratch, continue development on existing sites, and collaborate with cross-functional teams. We have covered topics like Responsive Design, Single Page Applications, Advanced State Management, etc. Reflecting on how far we have come during these six months, I am glad to say that I am happy with my career choice.",
