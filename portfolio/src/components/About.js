            I'm Erik Rodriguez, a Software Engineer from Moreno Valley,
            California. I have an interest in starting new projects or help
            further development on completed projects. What I have going on
            right now? Currently studying Full-Stack Web Development at Lambda
            School and on track to graduate Early September 2020. Are you taking
            any projects? Yes... soon. Collaborating with 3 teams and estimate
            completion is Late June 2020 . The collection of images below are
            about family and personal interest. Thanks for reading this far!
