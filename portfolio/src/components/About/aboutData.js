Since then, I've practiced problem-solving skills via Leetcode and teamwork/communication via Chingu hackathons. Recently, I landed an Apprenticeship opportunity with Microsoft, where I was part of a team that works on a cloud service called Azure Service Fabric. All that to say that after 4 months, I've secured an offer with Microsoft as a Software Engineer.",
